•    Expressions are values connected by operators. Expressions are all 
evaluated down to a single value. For example, 2 + 2 evaluates to 4 or 
'Hello' + ' ' + 'World' evaluates to 'Hello World'. When expressions are 
next to the if and for keywords, you can also call them conditions.
•	 Assignment statements store values in variables so you can remember 
the values later in the program.

•	 The if, for, and break statements are flow control statements that can 
make the execution skip instructions, loop over instructions, or break 
out of loops. Function calls also change the flow of execution by jumping to the instructions inside of a function.
•	 The print() and input() functions display text on the screen and get 
text from the keyboard. Instructions that deal with the input and output
of the program are called I/O (pronounced eye oh).

Escape character What is actually printed
\\                  Backslash (\)
\'                  Single quote (')
\"                  Double quote (")
\n                  Newline
\t                  Tab

The print() function automatically appends a newline character to the 
end of a string. Most of the time, this is a helpful shortcut. But sometimes 
you don’t want a newline character. To change this, you can pass a blank 
string as the keyword argument for print()’s end keyword parameter. For 
example, to print spam to the screen without a newline character, you would 
call print('spam', end='')

time.sleep(2) // will wait for 2 seconds
random.randint(1, 2) // will randomly select 1 or 2
